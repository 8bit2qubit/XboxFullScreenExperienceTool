## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

This tool is **only compatible with Windows 11 Insider Dev Channel builds `26220.6690` or later**.
If your system does not meet this requirement, the tool will display an error and exit.

> ### **Why is the Dev Channel Required? (Please Read)**
>
> This is a common question. While the Xbox full screen feature is present in other builds (like Release 25H2, `26200.xxxx`), the decision to support the **Dev Channel** is strictly for quality and stability.
>
> * **Known Bugs:** Non-Dev builds suffer from bugs that create a poor user experience. This includes:
>     * Instability with the **Task View**.
>     * Issues when **closing applications** (e.g., with the 'X' button).
>     * An exceptionally poor experience in `26200` builds prior to the `.6899` update.
>
> The Dev Channel offers a far more stable and mature implementation. Support for other channels will be considered if these issues are resolved in future public builds.
