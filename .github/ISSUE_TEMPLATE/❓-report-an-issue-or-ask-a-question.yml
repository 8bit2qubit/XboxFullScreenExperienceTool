            I have **read the entire** [**README**](https://github.com/8bit2qubit/XboxFullScreenExperienceTool?tab=readme-ov-file#readme), especially the following sections:

            *   **"System Requirements"** (I confirm my build is one of the **COMPATIBLE** builds: `26100.7019+`, `26200.7015+` or `26220.6972+`.)

            *   **"Screen Dimension Override for Desktop PCs & Laptops"** (I understand the difference between `PhysPanelCS` / `PhysPanelDrv`)

            *   **"Quick Start"** (I have followed the installation and initial setup steps.)

            I understand this tool is an **Enabler / Activation Utility / Configuration Tool** and not the implementer of the Full Screen Experience (FSE) feature. I understand FSE itself **is a Shell Replacement** that *replaces* the normal Windows desktop/taskbar, and FSE's behavior is not a bug in this tool.

            I have already tried going to the **Microsoft Store** to update all apps (especially Xbox and Game Bar).

            I have searched the [**existing Issues**](https://github.com/8bit2qubit/XboxFullScreenExperienceTool/issues) to ensure my problem is not already reported.
